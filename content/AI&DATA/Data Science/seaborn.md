# Difference Between Catplot vs Relplot

1. **Catplot**: The `catplot` function is used for plotting categorical data. It provides a high-level interface for drawing categorical plots onto a FacetGrid. This function provides access to several axes-level functions that show the relationship between a numerical and one or more categorical variables using one of several visual representations. Examples include box plots, violin plots, bar plots, and strip plots.

2. **Relplot**: The `relplot` function, on the other hand, is used for plotting relational data. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. This function is particularly good for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables, often using scatter plots or line plots. It also utilizes a FacetGrid, allowing you to create a grid of plots by mapping dataset columns to the rows and columns of the grid.

The key difference lies in the type of data they are best suited for: `catplot` is for categorical data and allows you to choose among different types of categorical plots, whereas `relplot` is for relational (usually numerical) data and focuses on scatter and line plots. Both functions offer the flexibility to plot across a FacetGrid, enabling easy comparison of subgroups within your data.

#whiskers

In Seaborn, which is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib, "whiskers" are a component of box plots and are used to represent the variability outside the upper and lower quartiles of the data. They provide a visual indication of the spread of the data and potential outliers.

Here's a detailed explanation of how whiskers work in Seaborn's box plots:

1. **Box**: The central box of a box plot represents the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). The line inside the box indicates the median of the data.

2. **Whiskers**: The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the data. By default, the whiskers extend to 1.5 * IQR above the third quartile and 1.5 * IQR below the first quartile. Any data point beyond this range is considered an outlier and is often represented with a different marker such as a dot.

3. **Outliers**: Points outside the end of the whiskers are considered outliers and are usually plotted individually.

It's important to note that the default behavior for whiskers can be adjusted in Seaborn. You can change the multiplier for the IQR to adjust how far the whiskers extend from the box. Additionally, you can set whiskers to represent a specific percentile or a specific range of data, depending on your specific needs and the nature of your dataset.

Using these whiskers, box plots provide a concise summary of the distribution of the data, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. This makes them extremely useful for comparing distributions between several groups or datasets.
