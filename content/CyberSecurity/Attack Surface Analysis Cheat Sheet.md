Attack Surface Analysis helps you to:

1. identify what functions and what parts of the system you need to review/test for security vulnerabilities
2. identify high risk areas of code that require defense-in-depth protection - what parts of the system that you need to defend
3. identify when you have changed the attack surface and need to do some kind of threat assessment
## Identifying and Mapping the Attack Surface[Â¶](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html#identifying-and-mapping-the-attack-surface "Permanent link")

You can start building a baseline description of the Attack Surface in a picture and notes. Spend a few hours reviewing design and architecture documents from an attacker's perspective. Read through the source code and identify different points of entry/exit:

- User interface (UI) forms and fields
- HTTP headers and cookies
- APIs
- Files
- Databases
- Other local storage
- Email or other kinds of messages
- Runtime arguments
- ...Your points of entry/exit

The total number of different attack points can easily add up into the thousands or more. To make this manageable, break the model into different types based on function, design and technology:

- Login/authentication entry points
- Admin interfaces
- Inquiries and search functions
- Data entry (CRUD) forms
- Business workflows
- Transactional interfaces/APIs
- Operational command and monitoring interfaces/APIs
- Interfaces with other applications/systems
- ...Your types
